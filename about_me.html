            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>I received training in the Life Sciences and obtained a doctoral degree in Environmental Biology.
            </p>
            <h4>However,</h4>
            <p>I developed interest in coding after I heard about "I Am The Code".</p>
            <p>I received coding training in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React JS at Tech Creek, Port Harcourt, Nigeria.</p>
            <h4>The goals that kept me going:</h4>
            <p>These goals kept me hopeful that I would complete my training at Tech Creek and make a mark in Tech. And here they are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>To have coding as a skill with which I would earn <strong>money</strong>. 
                    I planned to make a career change from being a University professor to a front-end web developer.</li>
                <li><p>To be so good to impart the skills to my younger daughter.</p></li>
            </ol>
        <p>Now, you know something about me.</p>
           <p>Thank you.</p>
